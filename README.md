# HSI-Tumor-Classification
The code is for the preprocessing and data extraction of hyperspectral medical images. It also employs algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to train classification models for distinguishing between tumorous lung tissue data and healthy lung tissue data.
